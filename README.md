# Development Environment [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Llcoolsouder/DevelopmentEnvironment.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Llcoolsouder/DevelopmentEnvironment)
This is just a docker container that contains all of the resources and tools that I like to use.

## Why?
1. It can be a pain to reinstall all of my stuff when I move to a new system. Now I don't have to.
2. I hate having to ask my manager every time I want something installed.
